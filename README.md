# About The Project

Use a turbine water flow sensor to read in volume flowed in mL, then call REST api to update project on Back4App. Calculate water volume with RPi.GPIO library on Raspberry pi 3A+. Make GET and PUT calls in requests library to read and update score from Back4App project. Use bash scripts to call scripts and send signals to specific processes. 

# Use

Run read_sensor.py to continually poll turbine water flow sensor. Alongside read_sensor.py, execute loop.sh to update Back4App with new water data. 

3 Wires:
- red (5-15 VDC
- black (GND)
- yellow (Hall effect pulse output)

Tracking
- Count Pulses
- each pulse is approximately 2.25 ml
- each Â¼  rotation represents shift between high and low
